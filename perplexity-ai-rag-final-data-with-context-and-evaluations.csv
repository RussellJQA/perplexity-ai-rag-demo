What is the method for excluding specific domains from search results in the provided context?,"To exclude specific domains from search results, use the `search_domain_filter` parameter in your request and prefix the domain names with a minus sign (`-`). For example:

```json
""search_domain_filter"": [
    ""-example.com""
]
```","To exclude specific domains from search results in the provided context, you can use the `search_domain_filter` feature by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`). 

Here's how you would include it in a request payload:

```json
""search_domain_filter"": [
    ""-example.com""
]
```

This will filter out any results from `example.com`. You can include multiple domains to exclude by adding more entries to the list, ensuring each is prefixed with the minus sign.","**Pro-tip**: Use `high` for research-heavy or nuanced queries where coverage matters more than cost.

# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters

<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
""search_domain_filter"": [
  ""<domain1>"",
  ""<domain2>"",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries.""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""nasa.gov"",
        ""wikipedia.org"",
        ""space.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.

### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-deep-research"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",
        ""-reddit.com"",
        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification
**Good Example**: ""Compare the energy efficiency ratings of heat pumps vs. traditional HVAC systems for residential use""

    **Poor Example**: ""Tell me which home heating is better""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Provide Relevant Context"">
    Include critical context to guide the web search toward the most relevant content, but keep prompts concise and focused.

    **Good Example**: ""Explain the impact of the 2023 EU digital markets regulations on app store competition for small developers""

    **Poor Example**: ""What are the rules for app stores?""
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Web Search Model Pitfalls to Avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title=""Overly Generic Questions"">
    Generic prompts lead to scattered web search results and unfocused responses. Always narrow your scope.

    **Avoid**: ""What's happening in AI?""

    **Instead**: ""What are the three most significant commercial applications of generative AI in healthcare in the past year?""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Traditional LLM Techniques"">
    Prompting strategies designed for traditional LLMs often don't work well with web search models. Adapt your approach accordingly.

    **Avoid**: ""Act as an expert chef and give me a recipe for sourdough bread. Start by explaining the history of sourdough, then list ingredients, then...""

    **Instead**: ""What's a reliable sourdough bread recipe for beginners? Include ingredients and step-by-step instructions.""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Complex Multi-Part Requests"">
    Complex prompts with multiple unrelated questions can confuse the search component. Focus on one topic per query.

    **Avoid**: ""Explain quantum computing, and also tell me about regenerative agriculture, and provide stock market predictions.""

    **Instead**: ""Explain quantum computing principles that might impact cryptography in the next decade.""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Assuming Search Intent"">
    Don't assume the model will search for what you intended without specific direction. Be explicit about exactly what information you need.

    **Avoid**: ""Tell me about the latest developments.""

    **Instead**: ""What are the latest developments in offshore wind energy technology announced in the past 6 months?""
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Advanced Techniques

<Tip>
  We recommend for users *not* to tune language parameters such as `temperature`, as the default settings for these have already been optimized.
</Tip>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title=""Parameter Optimization"">
    Adjust model parameters based on your specific needs:

    * **Search Domain Filter**: Limit results to trusted sources for research-heavy queries.
    * **Search Context Size**: Use ""high"" for comprehensive research questions and ""low"" for simple factual queries.

    Example configuration for technical documentation:

    ```json
    {
      ""search_domain_filter"": [""wikipedia.org"", ""docs.python.org""],
      ""web_search_options"": {
        ""search_context_size"": ""medium""
      }

# Search Context Size
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-context-size-guide

<Note>
  The `search_context_size` parameter allows you to control how much search context is retrieved from the web during query resolution, letting you balance cost and comprehensiveness.
</Note>

<Warning>
  * Default `search_context_size` is `low`
  * Selecting `""high""` increases search costs due to more extensive web retrieval. Use `""low""` when cost efficiency is critical.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_context_size` field—passed via the `web_search_options` object—determines how much search context is retrieved by the Sonar models. This setting can help you optimize for either:

* Cost savings with minimal search input (`low`)
* Comprehensive answers by maximizing retrieved information (`high`)
* A balance of both (`medium`)

This flexibility allows teams to tune their API usage to their budget and use case.

To enable this feature, include the web\_search\_options.search\_context\_size parameter in your request payload:

```bash
""web_search_options"": {
  ""search_context_size"": ""medium""
}
```

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Context Size**

* `low`: Best for short factual queries or when operating under strict token cost constraints.
* `medium`: The default and best suited for general use cases.
* `high`: Use for deep research, exploratory questions, or when citations and evidence coverage are critical.

**Cost Optimization**

* Selecting `low` or `medium` can significantly reduce overall token usage, especially at scale.
* Consider defaulting to `low` for high-volume endpoints and selectively upgrading to `high` for complex user prompts.

Combining with Other Filters

* You can use `search_context_size` alongside other features like `search_domain_filter` to further control the scope of search.
* Combining `medium` with a focused domain filter often gives a good tradeoff between quality and cost.

Performance Considerations
**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: ""json_schema"", json_schema: {""schema"": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: ""regex"", regex: {""regex"": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    year_of_birth: int

# Frequently Asked Questions
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/faq/faq

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=""Why isn't the `response_format` parameter working for reasoning models?"">
    The `sonar-reasoning-pro` model is designed to output a `<think>` section containing reasoning tokens, immediately followed by a valid JSON object. As a result, the `response_format` parameter does not remove these reasoning tokens from the output.

    We recommend using a custom parser to extract the valid JSON portion. An example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/blob/main/utils/extract_json_reasoning_models.py).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does the API use content filtering or SafeSearch?"">
    Yes, for the API, content filtering in the form of SafeSearch is turned on by default. This helps filter out potentially offensive and inappropriate content, including pornography, from search results. SafeSearch is an automated filter that works across search results to provide a safer experience. You can learn more about SafeSearch on the [official Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How do I file a bug report and what happens afterward?"">
    To file a bug report, please use our GitHub repository and file the bug in [issues](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/issues). Once you've submitted your report, we kindly ask that you share the link to the issue with us via email at [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) so we can track it on our end.

    We truly appreciate your patience, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Due to the current volume of reports, it may take a little time for us to respond—but rest assured, we're on it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Where are Perplexity's language models hosted?"">
    Our compute is hosted via Amazon Web Services in North America. By default, the API has zero day retention of user prompt data, which is never used for AI training.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How can I upgrade to the next usage tier?"">
    The only way for an account to be upgraded to the next usage tier is through all-time credit purchase.

    Here are the spending criteria associated with each tier:
Here are the spending criteria associated with each tier:

    | Tier   | Credit Purchase (all time) |
    | ------ | -------------------------- |
    | Tier 0 | -                          |
    | Tier 1 | \$50                       |
    | Tier 2 | \$250                      |
    | Tier 3 | \$500                      |
    | Tier 4 | \$1000                     |
    | Tier 5 | \$5000                     |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How can I track my spend/usage per API key?"">
    We offer a way to track your billing per API key. You can do this by navigating to the following location:

    **Settings > View Dashboard > Invoice history > Invoices**

    Then click on any invoice and each item from the total bill will have a code at the end of it (e.g., pro (743S)). Those 4 characters are the last 4 of your API key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How do I request a new feature?"">
    A Feature Request is a suggestion to improve or add new functionality to the Perplexity Sonar API, such as:

    * Requesting support for a new model or capability (e.g., image processing, fine-tuning options)
    * Asking for new API parameters (e.g., additional filters, search options)
    * Suggesting performance improvements (e.g., faster response times, better citation handling)
    * Enhancing existing API features (e.g., improving streaming reliability, adding new output formats)

    If your request aligns with these, please submit a feature request here: [Github Feature requests](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/issues)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Why are the results from the API different from the UI? "">
    1. The API uses the same search system as the UI with differences in configuration—so their outputs may differ.
    2. The underlying AI model might differ between the API and the UI for a given query.
    3. We give users the power to tune the API to their respective use cases using sampling parameters like `presence_penalty`, `top_p`, etc. Custom tuning to specific use cases might lead to less generalization compared to the UI. We set optimized defaults and recommend not to explicitly provide sampling parameters in your API requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Will user data submitted through the API be used for model training or other purposes?"">
    We collect the following types of information:

    **API Usage Data:** We collect billable usage metadata such as the number of requests and tokens. You can view your own usage in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api).

    **User Account Information:** When you create an account with us, we collect your name, email address, and other relevant contact information.

    We do not retain any query data sent through the API and do not train on any of your data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does the API currently support web browsing?"">
    Yes, the [Sonar Models](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards) leverage information from Perplexity's search index and the public internet.

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Specificity**
•	**Latitude/Longitude:** Use for high precision when the exact location is known and relevant (e.g., finding nearby points of interest).
•	**Country Code:** Use for broader context when country-level relevance is sufficient (e.g., national news, country-specific regulations).
•	**Combining Fields:** Providing both coordinates and country code can offer the most context. The coordinates give precision, while the country code adds broader regional signals (like language or national context) that might influence results.

**Data Accuracy**
•	Ensure the provided location data is as accurate as possible. Incorrect data may lead to irrelevant results.
•	Latitude values must be between -90 and 90. Longitude values must be between -180 and 180.
•	Country codes should be valid two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (e.g., ""US"", ""GB"", ""DE"").

**Privacy Considerations**
•	Be mindful of user privacy when collecting and transmitting location data. Only use location when necessary and with user consent where applicable.

**Client-Side Validation**
•	Consider validating location inputs before sending the request:

* Check latitude/longitude ranges.
* Validate country code format (two uppercase letters).

# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters

<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
""search_domain_filter"": [
  ""<domain1>"",
  ""<domain2>"",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries.""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""nasa.gov"",
        ""wikipedia.org"",
        ""space.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.

### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-deep-research"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",
        ""-reddit.com"",
        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

    --data '{
      ""model"": ""sonar"",
      ""return_images"": true,
      ""image_domain_filter"": [""-gettyimages.com""],
      ""image_format_filter"": [""gif""],
      ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Show me a gif of a dog""}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
  headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
  payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar"",
    ""return_images"": True,
    ""image_domain_filter"": [""-gettyimages.com""],
    ""image_format_filter"": [""gif""],
    ""messages"": [
      {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Show me a gif of a dog""}
    ]
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

⸻

## Best Practices
**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: ""json_schema"", json_schema: {""schema"": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: ""regex"", regex: {""regex"": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    year_of_birth: int
    num_seasons_in_nba: int

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""

# Search Context Size
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-context-size-guide

<Note>
  The `search_context_size` parameter allows you to control how much search context is retrieved from the web during query resolution, letting you balance cost and comprehensiveness.
</Note>

<Warning>
  * Default `search_context_size` is `low`
  * Selecting `""high""` increases search costs due to more extensive web retrieval. Use `""low""` when cost efficiency is critical.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_context_size` field—passed via the `web_search_options` object—determines how much search context is retrieved by the Sonar models. This setting can help you optimize for either:

* Cost savings with minimal search input (`low`)
* Comprehensive answers by maximizing retrieved information (`high`)
* A balance of both (`medium`)

This flexibility allows teams to tune their API usage to their budget and use case.

To enable this feature, include the web\_search\_options.search\_context\_size parameter in your request payload:

```bash
""web_search_options"": {
  ""search_context_size"": ""medium""
}
```

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Context Size**

* `low`: Best for short factual queries or when operating under strict token cost constraints.
* `medium`: The default and best suited for general use cases.
* `high`: Use for deep research, exploratory questions, or when citations and evidence coverage are critical.

**Cost Optimization**

* Selecting `low` or `medium` can significantly reduce overall token usage, especially at scale.
* Consider defaulting to `low` for high-volume endpoints and selectively upgrading to `high` for complex user prompts.

Combining with Other Filters

* You can use `search_context_size` alongside other features like `search_domain_filter` to further control the scope of search.
* Combining `medium` with a focused domain filter often gives a good tradeoff between quality and cost.

# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters

<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
""search_domain_filter"": [
  ""<domain1>"",
  ""<domain2>"",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries.""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""nasa.gov"",
        ""wikipedia.org"",
        ""space.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.

### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-deep-research"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",
        ""-reddit.com"",
        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices
This update makes it easier to:

    * Verify the sources used in generating responses
    * Create custom citation formats for your applications
    * Filter or prioritize certain sources based on your needs

    **Important: The `citations` field is being deprecated in favor of the new `search_results` field.** Please update your applications to use the `search_results` field, as the `citations` field will be removed in a future update.

    The `search_results` field is now available across all our search-enabled models.

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: ""json_schema"", json_schema: {""schema"": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: ""regex"", regex: {""regex"": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    year_of_birth: int
    num_seasons_in_nba: int

            ""Tell me about Michael Jordan. ""
            ""Please output a JSON object containing the following fields: ""
            ""first_name, last_name, year_of_birth, num_seasons_in_nba. ""
        )},
    ],
    ""response_format"": {
		    ""type"": ""json_schema"",
        ""json_schema"": {""schema"": AnswerFormat.model_json_schema()},
    },
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Response**",FAITHFUL,"The text accurately describes the impact of applying overly restrictive domain filters on search results and aligns with the information provided in the source, which states that such filters may lead to fewer search results and negatively affect the quality of responses. Therefore, it is a faithful representation of the source material.",non-contradictory,"The ANSWER discusses the effects of overly restrictive domain filters on search results, indicating that they can lead to a limited number of results and negatively impact quality, similar to the REFERENCE.

# Perplexity Crawlers
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots

We strive to improve our service every day by delivering the best search experience possible. To achieve this, we collect data using web crawlers (“robots”) and user agents that gather and index information from the internet, operating either automatically or in response to user requests. Webmasters can use the following robots.txt tags to manage how their sites and content interact with Perplexity. Each setting works independently, and it may take up to 24 hours for our systems to reflect changes.
## Making Your First API Call

* Once you have your API key, you can make your first API call.
* Send the API key as a bearer token in the Authorization header with each request.

# Image Filters Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/image-filter-guide

Control image results with domain and format filters using the Perplexity API.

<Note>
  The `image_domain_filter` and `image_format_filter` parameters allow you to control the sources and file types of image results returned by the Sonar models.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can include a maximum of 10 entries in each of the filter lists. These filters currently apply only when `""return_images"": true` is set in your request.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `image_domain_filter` and `image_format_filter` parameters give you fine-grained control over image results returned by the Sonar models. Use these filters to:

* Exclude specific image providers (e.g., Getty Images)
* Restrict to a specific file format (e.g., `.gif`)

To use these filters, your request must include `""return_images"": true`.

```json
{
  ""image_domain_filter"": [""-gettyimages.com""],
  ""image_format_filter"": [""gif""]
}

	•	Prefix domains with - to exclude them
	•	Use lowercase file extensions like gif, jpg, or png
```

# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters

<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
""search_domain_filter"": [
  ""<domain1>"",
  ""<domain2>"",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries.""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""nasa.gov"",
        ""wikipedia.org"",
        ""space.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.

### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-deep-research"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",
        ""-reddit.com"",
        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Web Search Model Pitfalls to Avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title=""Overly Generic Questions"">
    Generic prompts lead to scattered web search results and unfocused responses. Always narrow your scope.

    **Avoid**: ""What's happening in AI?""

    **Instead**: ""What are the three most significant commercial applications of generative AI in healthcare in the past year?""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Traditional LLM Techniques"">
    Prompting strategies designed for traditional LLMs often don't work well with web search models. Adapt your approach accordingly.

    **Avoid**: ""Act as an expert chef and give me a recipe for sourdough bread. Start by explaining the history of sourdough, then list ingredients, then...""

    **Instead**: ""What's a reliable sourdough bread recipe for beginners? Include ingredients and step-by-step instructions.""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Complex Multi-Part Requests"">
    Complex prompts with multiple unrelated questions can confuse the search component. Focus on one topic per query.

    **Avoid**: ""Explain quantum computing, and also tell me about regenerative agriculture, and provide stock market predictions.""

    **Instead**: ""Explain quantum computing principles that might impact cryptography in the next decade.""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Assuming Search Intent"">
    Don't assume the model will search for what you intended without specific direction. Be explicit about exactly what information you need.

    **Avoid**: ""Tell me about the latest developments.""

    **Instead**: ""What are the latest developments in offshore wind energy technology announced in the past 6 months?""

# Search Context Size
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-context-size-guide

<Note>
  The `search_context_size` parameter allows you to control how much search context is retrieved from the web during query resolution, letting you balance cost and comprehensiveness.
</Note>

<Warning>
  * Default `search_context_size` is `low`
  * Selecting `""high""` increases search costs due to more extensive web retrieval. Use `""low""` when cost efficiency is critical.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_context_size` field—passed via the `web_search_options` object—determines how much search context is retrieved by the Sonar models. This setting can help you optimize for either:

* Cost savings with minimal search input (`low`)
* Comprehensive answers by maximizing retrieved information (`high`)
* A balance of both (`medium`)

This flexibility allows teams to tune their API usage to their budget and use case.

To enable this feature, include the web\_search\_options.search\_context\_size parameter in your request payload:

```bash
""web_search_options"": {
  ""search_context_size"": ""medium""
}
```

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Context Size**

* `low`: Best for short factual queries or when operating under strict token cost constraints.
* `medium`: The default and best suited for general use cases.
* `high`: Use for deep research, exploratory questions, or when citations and evidence coverage are critical.

**Cost Optimization**

* Selecting `low` or `medium` can significantly reduce overall token usage, especially at scale.
* Consider defaulting to `low` for high-volume endpoints and selectively upgrading to `high` for complex user prompts.

Combining with Other Filters

* You can use `search_context_size` alongside other features like `search_domain_filter` to further control the scope of search.
* Combining `medium` with a focused domain filter often gives a good tradeoff between quality and cost.

Performance Considerations
**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: ""json_schema"", json_schema: {""schema"": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: ""regex"", regex: {""regex"": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests

* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: ""json_schema"", json_schema: {""schema"": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: ""regex"", regex: {""regex"": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    year_of_birth: int
    num_seasons_in_nba: int

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""

        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": (
            ""Tell me about Michael Jordan. ""
            ""Please output a JSON object containing the following fields: ""
            ""first_name, last_name, year_of_birth, num_seasons_in_nba. ""
        )},
    ],
    ""response_format"": {
		    ""type"": ""json_schema"",
        ""json_schema"": {""schema"": AnswerFormat.model_json_schema()},
    },
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Response**
**Pro-tip**: Use `high` for research-heavy or nuanced queries where coverage matters more than cost.

# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters

<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
""search_domain_filter"": [
  ""<domain1>"",
  ""<domain2>"",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries.""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""nasa.gov"",
        ""wikipedia.org"",
        ""space.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.

### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-deep-research"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",
        ""-reddit.com"",
        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

There is no factual contradiction between the two statements."
What are the implications of using subdomains versus main domains in domain filtering?,"Using subdomains versus main domains in domain filtering can significantly impact search results. 

1. **Specificity**: Subdomains (e.g., `blog.example.com`) may lead to more targeted content related to that specific subdomain, while using the main domain (e.g., `example.com`) filters results from all its subdomains, providing a broader range of content from the entire domain.

2. **Inclusion/Exclusion**: Specifying the main domain allows filtering out all subdomains uniformly; however, using subdomains may lead to excluding relevant content from the main domain.

3. **Search Quality**: Main domains often capture a wider variety of information and resources, potentially improving the overall quality of search responses compared to filtering down to one subdomain.

Overall, the choice between using main domains and subdomains should align with the desired specificity and breadth of information in the search results.","Using subdomains versus main domains in domain filtering has specific implications:

1. **Scope of Filtering**:
   - **Main Domains**: When you filter by a main domain (e.g., `example.com`), all subdomains (like `blog.example.com` or `shop.example.com`) are included automatically. This can be useful if you want to encompass all content associated with a primary domain.
   - **Subdomains**: If you specify a subdomain (e.g., `blog.example.com`), only that subdomain will be included or excluded. This allows for more granular control but may limit the range of results if other relevant content resides in the main domain or other subdomains.

2. **Content Availability**:
   - Filtering using only the main domain may yield more comprehensive results, as it captures all content under that domain, potentially providing richer information on a topic.
   - Conversely, filtering by a specific subdomain could lead to a lack of diverse perspectives or information if the needed data is hosted elsewhere within the domain.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Using broader main domains may increase response times slightly due to the wider net being cast during searches, but it generally provides a better overall context for research-heavy queries.
   - Narrowing focus to subdomains can improve relevance for specific inquiries but may also reduce the quantity of available results.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - It is typically advised to utilize main domains unless there is a clear reason to limit searches to specific subdomains (e.g., excluding unwanted content from a broader domain).

In summary, deciding between main domains and subdomains in filtering needs careful consideration of the scope, relevance, and potential exposure to different types of content.","**Pro-tip**: Use `high` for research-heavy or nuanced queries where coverage matters more than cost.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification
**Good Example**: ""Compare the energy efficiency ratings of heat pumps vs. traditional HVAC systems for residential use""

    **Poor Example**: ""Tell me which home heating is better""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Provide Relevant Context"">
    Include critical context to guide the web search toward the most relevant content, but keep prompts concise and focused.

    **Good Example**: ""Explain the impact of the 2023 EU digital markets regulations on app store competition for small developers""

    **Poor Example**: ""What are the rules for app stores?""
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Web Search Model Pitfalls to Avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title=""Overly Generic Questions"">
    Generic prompts lead to scattered web search results and unfocused responses. Always narrow your scope.

    **Avoid**: ""What's happening in AI?""

    **Instead**: ""What are the three most significant commercial applications of generative AI in healthcare in the past year?""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Traditional LLM Techniques"">
    Prompting strategies designed for traditional LLMs often don't work well with web search models. Adapt your approach accordingly.

    **Avoid**: ""Act as an expert chef and give me a recipe for sourdough bread. Start by explaining the history of sourdough, then list ingredients, then...""

    **Instead**: ""What's a reliable sourdough bread recipe for beginners? Include ingredients and step-by-step instructions.""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Complex Multi-Part Requests"">
    Complex prompts with multiple unrelated questions can confuse the search component. Focus on one topic per query.

    **Avoid**: ""Explain quantum computing, and also tell me about regenerative agriculture, and provide stock market predictions.""

    **Instead**: ""Explain quantum computing principles that might impact cryptography in the next decade.""
  </Card>

  <Card title=""Assuming Search Intent"">
    Don't assume the model will search for what you intended without specific direction. Be explicit about exactly what information you need.

    **Avoid**: ""Tell me about the latest developments.""

    **Instead**: ""What are the latest developments in offshore wind energy technology announced in the past 6 months?""
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Advanced Techniques

<Tip>
  We recommend for users *not* to tune language parameters such as `temperature`, as the default settings for these have already been optimized.
</Tip>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title=""Parameter Optimization"">
    Adjust model parameters based on your specific needs:

    * **Search Domain Filter**: Limit results to trusted sources for research-heavy queries.
    * **Search Context Size**: Use ""high"" for comprehensive research questions and ""low"" for simple factual queries.

    Example configuration for technical documentation:

    ```json
    {
      ""search_domain_filter"": [""wikipedia.org"", ""docs.python.org""],
      ""web_search_options"": {
        ""search_context_size"": ""medium""

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      ""model"": ""sonar"",
      ""return_images"": true,
      ""image_domain_filter"": [""-gettyimages.com""],
      ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Show me images of Mount Everest""}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
  headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}

    ""image_domain_filter"": [""-gettyimages.com""],
    ""messages"": [
      {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Show me images of Mount Everest""}
    ]
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Only Return GIFs

This request restricts results to GIF images.

<CodeGroup>
  ```cURL cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      ""model"": ""sonar"",
      ""return_images"": true,
      ""image_format_filter"": [""gif""],
      ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Show me a funny cat gif""}
      ]
    }'
  ```

  ```python python
  import requests

  url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""

    ""image_format_filter"": [""gif""],
    ""messages"": [
      {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Show me a gif of a dog""}
    ]
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
  print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices
**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.


# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>

## Overview

We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:

* The output exceeds `max_tokens`

Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:

**JSON Schema**

* `response_format: { type: ""json_schema"", json_schema: {""schema"": object} }` .

* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.

**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)

* `response_format: { type: ""regex"", regex: {""regex"": str} }` .

* The regex is a regular expression string.

We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Get a response in JSON format

**Request**

```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    year_of_birth: int
    num_seasons_in_nba: int

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""Be precise and concise.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": (
            ""Tell me about Michael Jordan. ""
            ""Please output a JSON object containing the following fields: ""
            ""first_name, last_name, year_of_birth, num_seasons_in_nba. ""
        )},
    ],
    ""response_format"": {
		    ""type"": ""json_schema"",
        ""json_schema"": {""schema"": AnswerFormat.model_json_schema()},
    },
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Response**

    We email users about new developments and also post in the [changelog](/changelog.mdx).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How should I respond to 401: Authorization errors?"">
    401 error codes indicate that the provided API key is invalid, deleted, or belongs to an account which ran out of credits. You likely need to purchase more credits in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api). You can avoid this issue by configuring auto-top-up.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Do you support fine-tuning?"">
    Currently, we do not support fine-tuning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""I have another question or an issue"">
    Please reach out to [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) or [support@perplexity.ai](mailto:support@perplexity.ai) for other API inquiries. You can also post on our [discussion forum](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/discussions) and we will get back to you.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Do you expose CoTs if I use your reasoning APIs or Deep Research API?"">
    We expose the CoTs for Sonar Reasoning Pro and Sonar Reasoning. We don't currently expose the CoTs for Deep Research.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does R1-1776 search the web?"">
    R1-1776 is an offline chat model that does not search the web. So this model might not have the most up-to-date information beyond its training cutoff date—which should be the same as R1.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Are the reasoning tokens in Deep Research same as CoTs in the answer?"">
    Reasoning tokens in Deep Research are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer—these tokens are used to reason through the research material before generating the final output via the CoTs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Is the internet data access provided by the API identical to that of Perplexity's web interface?"">
    Yes, the API offers exactly the same internet data access as Perplexity's web platform.

# Frequently Asked Questions
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/faq/faq

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=""Why isn't the `response_format` parameter working for reasoning models?"">
    The `sonar-reasoning-pro` model is designed to output a `<think>` section containing reasoning tokens, immediately followed by a valid JSON object. As a result, the `response_format` parameter does not remove these reasoning tokens from the output.

    We recommend using a custom parser to extract the valid JSON portion. An example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/blob/main/utils/extract_json_reasoning_models.py).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does the API use content filtering or SafeSearch?"">
    Yes, for the API, content filtering in the form of SafeSearch is turned on by default. This helps filter out potentially offensive and inappropriate content, including pornography, from search results. SafeSearch is an automated filter that works across search results to provide a safer experience. You can learn more about SafeSearch on the [official Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How do I file a bug report and what happens afterward?"">
    To file a bug report, please use our GitHub repository and file the bug in [issues](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/issues). Once you've submitted your report, we kindly ask that you share the link to the issue with us via email at [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) so we can track it on our end.

    We truly appreciate your patience, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Due to the current volume of reports, it may take a little time for us to respond—but rest assured, we're on it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Where are Perplexity's language models hosted?"">
    Our compute is hosted via Amazon Web Services in North America. By default, the API has zero day retention of user prompt data, which is never used for AI training.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How can I upgrade to the next usage tier?"">
    The only way for an account to be upgraded to the next usage tier is through all-time credit purchase.

    Here are the spending criteria associated with each tier:

## Managing API Keys

<Info>
  The API key is a long-lived access token that can be used until it is manually refreshed or deleted.
</Info>

* Every API call needs a valid API key. You must send the API key as a bearer token in the Authorization header with each API request.

Admins can generate and revoke API keys from the **API Keys** tab.

### To create a key:

* Click **+ Create Key** to generate a new API key.

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Never expose them in client-side code or share them in public repositories.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  If you run out of credits, your API keys will be blocked until you add to your credit balance. You can avoid this by configuring ""Automatic Top Up"", which refreshes your balance whenever you drop below \$2.
</Warning>

# Perplexity Crawlers
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots

We strive to improve our service every day by delivering the best search experience possible. To achieve this, we collect data using web crawlers (“robots”) and user agents that gather and index information from the internet, operating either automatically or in response to user requests. Webmasters can use the following robots.txt tags to manage how their sites and content interact with Perplexity. Each setting works independently, and it may take up to 24 hours for our systems to reflect changes.

# Frequently Asked Questions
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/faq/faq

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=""Why isn't the `response_format` parameter working for reasoning models?"">
    The `sonar-reasoning-pro` model is designed to output a `<think>` section containing reasoning tokens, immediately followed by a valid JSON object. As a result, the `response_format` parameter does not remove these reasoning tokens from the output.

    We recommend using a custom parser to extract the valid JSON portion. An example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/blob/main/utils/extract_json_reasoning_models.py).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does the API use content filtering or SafeSearch?"">
    Yes, for the API, content filtering in the form of SafeSearch is turned on by default. This helps filter out potentially offensive and inappropriate content, including pornography, from search results. SafeSearch is an automated filter that works across search results to provide a safer experience. You can learn more about SafeSearch on the [official Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How do I file a bug report and what happens afterward?"">
    To file a bug report, please use our GitHub repository and file the bug in [issues](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/issues). Once you've submitted your report, we kindly ask that you share the link to the issue with us via email at [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) so we can track it on our end.

    We truly appreciate your patience, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Due to the current volume of reports, it may take a little time for us to respond—but rest assured, we're on it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Where are Perplexity's language models hosted?"">
    Our compute is hosted via Amazon Web Services in North America. By default, the API has zero day retention of user prompt data, which is never used for AI training.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How can I upgrade to the next usage tier?"">
    The only way for an account to be upgraded to the next usage tier is through all-time credit purchase.

    Here are the spending criteria associated with each tier:
<Accordion title=""What are the limitations to the number of API calls?"">
    You can find our [rate limits here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""What's the best way to stay up to date with API updates?"">
    We email users about new developments and also post in the [changelog](/changelog.mdx).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""How should I respond to 401: Authorization errors?"">
    401 error codes indicate that the provided API key is invalid, deleted, or belongs to an account which ran out of credits. You likely need to purchase more credits in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api). You can avoid this issue by configuring auto-top-up.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Do you support fine-tuning?"">
    Currently, we do not support fine-tuning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""I have another question or an issue"">
    Please reach out to [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) or [support@perplexity.ai](mailto:support@perplexity.ai) for other API inquiries. You can also post on our [discussion forum](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/discussions) and we will get back to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does Perplexity provide service quality assurances such as service uptime, frequency of failures, and target recovery time in the event of a failure?"">
    We do not guarantee this at the moment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Where are your DeepSeek reasoning models behind Sonar Reasoning and Sonar Reasoning Pro hosted? Is my data going to China?"">
    The models are hosted in the US and we do not train on any of your data. And no, your data is not going to China.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Are your reasoning APIs that use DeepSeek uncensored?"">
    Yes, our reasoning APIs that use DeepSeek's models are uncensored and on par with the other APIs in terms of content moderation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Do you expose CoTs if I use your reasoning APIs or Deep Research API?"">
    We expose the CoTs for Sonar Reasoning Pro and Sonar Reasoning. We don't currently expose the CoTs for Deep Research.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Does R1-1776 search the web?"">
    R1-1776 is an offline chat model that does not search the web. So this model might not have the most up-to-date information beyond its training cutoff date—which should be the same as R1.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Are the reasoning tokens in Deep Research same as CoTs in the answer?"">
    Reasoning tokens in Deep Research are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer—these tokens are used to reason through the research material before generating the final output via the CoTs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=""Is the internet data access provided by the API identical to that of Perplexity's web interface?"">
    Yes, the API offers exactly the same internet data access as Perplexity's web platform.
  </Accordion>
