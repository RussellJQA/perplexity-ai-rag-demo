# Search Domain Filter Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/search-domain-filters



<Note>
  The `search_domain_filter` feature allows you to limit search results to specific domains or exclude certain domains from search results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can add a maximum of 10 domains to the `search_domain_filter` list.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `search_domain_filter` parameter allows you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the Sonar models. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:

* Restrict search results to trusted sources
* Filter out specific domains from search results
* Focus research on particular websites

Enabling domain filtering can be done by adding a `search_domain_filter` field in the request:

```
""search_domain_filter"": [
  ""<domain1>"",
  ""<domain2>"",
  ...
]
```

Each entry in the list should be a simple domain name. To exclude a domain, prefix it with a minus sign (`-`).

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the James Webb Space Telescope discoveries.""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""nasa.gov"",
        ""wikipedia.org"",
        ""space.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.;### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",

        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.

<Info>
  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.;This is particularly useful for queries where location significantly impacts relevance, such as:

* Finding local businesses or services.
* Getting information about regional events or news.
* Understanding location-specific regulations or customs.

To refine search results by location, include the `user_location` object within the `web_search_options` in your request payload. You can provide coordinates, a country code, or combine them:

    ""longitude"": -122.4194
  }
}
```

**Using Country Code:**

```json
""web_search_options"": {
  ""user_location"": {
    ""country"": ""US""
  }
}
```

**Combining Latitude/Longitude and Country Code:**

```json
""web_search_options"": {
  ""user_location"": {
    ""latitude"": 48.8566, 
    ""longitude"": 2.3522,
    ""country"": ""FR"" // Example: Paris, France
  }
}
```

These filters work alongside other search parameters like date range or domain filters.

## Examples

**1. Refining Results with Latitude and Longitude**

This example provides specific coordinates (approximating San Francisco) to get geographically relevant search results.

**Request Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL

        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful local guide.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are some good coffee shops nearby?""}
      ],
      ""web_search_options"": {
        ""user_location"": {
          ""latitude"": 37.7749,
          ""longitude"": -122.4194
        }
      }
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
  headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
  payload = {
      ""model"": ""sonar-pro"",
      ""messages"": [
          {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful local guide."
4,Can both inclusion and exclusion of domains be combined in the same API request?,"Yes, both inclusion and exclusion of domains can be combined in the same API request, such as using `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`.","### 2. Denylist Specific Domains

This example shows how to exclude specific domains from search results by prefixing the domain name with a minus sign (`-`).

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-deep-research"",
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?""}
    ],
    ""search_domain_filter"": [
        ""-pinterest.com"",
        ""-reddit.com"",
        ""-quora.com""
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names with a minus prefix (e.g., `-pinterest.com`) to exclude domains from search results.

## Best Practices

### Domain Specification

* **Use simple domain names**: Specify domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or subdomain specifiers (`www.`).
* **Main domains only**: Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains as well.

### Filter Optimization

* **Be specific**: Use domains that are most relevant to your query to get the best results.
* **Combine approaches**: You can mix inclusion and exclusion in the same request (e.g., `[""wikipedia.org"", ""-pinterest.com""]`).
* **Limit filter size**: Although you can add up to 10 domains, using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.

### Performance Considerations

* Adding domain filters may slightly increase response time as the search engine needs to apply additional filtering.
* Overly restrictive domain filters might result in fewer search results, potentially affecting the quality of the response.

## Examples

### 1. Allowlist Specific Domains

This example shows how to limit search results to only include content from specific domains.

**Request**

```python
import requests

url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
payload = {
    ""model"": ""sonar-reasoning-pro"",
    ""messages"": [

    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response[""choices""][0][""message""][""content""])
```

**Best Practice**: Use simple domain names (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) without additional elements like `https://` or `www.` prefixes.;This setting can help you optimize for either:

* Cost savings with minimal search input (`low`)
* Comprehensive answers by maximizing retrieved information (`high`)
* A balance of both (`medium`)

This flexibility allows teams to tune their API usage to their budget and use case.

To enable this feature, include the web\_search\_options.search\_context\_size parameter in your request payload:

```bash
""web_search_options"": {
  ""search_context_size"": ""medium""
}
```

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Context Size**

* `low`: Best for short factual queries or when operating under strict token cost constraints.
* `medium`: The default and best suited for general use cases.
* `high`: Use for deep research, exploratory questions, or when citations and evidence coverage are critical.

**Cost Optimization**

* Selecting `low` or `medium` can significantly reduce overall token usage, especially at scale.
* Consider defaulting to `low` for high-volume endpoints and selectively upgrading to `high` for complex user prompts.

Combining with Other Filters

* You can use `search_context_size` alongside other features like `search_domain_filter` to further control the scope of search.
* Combining `medium` with a focused domain filter often gives a good tradeoff between quality and cost.

Performance Considerations

* Larger context sizes may slightly increase response latency due to more extensive search and reranking.
* If you’re batching queries or supporting real-time interfaces, test with different settings to balance user experience and runtime.

## Examples

**1. Minimal Search Context (""low"")**

This option limits the search context retrieved for the model, reducing cost per request while still producing useful responses for simpler questions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=""New: Asynchronous API for Sonar Deep Research"" description=""May 2025"">
    We're excited to announce the addition of an asynchronous API for Sonar Deep Research, designed specifically for research-intensive tasks that may take longer to process.

    This new API allows you to submit requests and retrieve results later, making it ideal for complex research queries that require extensive processing time.

    The asynchronous API endpoints include:

    1. `GET https://api.perplexity.ai/async/chat/completions` - Lists all asynchronous chat completion requests for the authenticated user
    2. `POST https://api.perplexity.ai/async/chat/completions` - Creates an asynchronous chat completion job
    3. `GET https://api.perplexity.ai/async/chat/completions/{request_id}` - Retrieves the status and result of a specific asynchronous chat completion job

    **Note:** Async requests have a time-to-live (TTL) of 7 days. After this period, the request and its results will no longer be accessible."
7,What are the implications of using subdomains versus main domains in domain filtering?,"Using subdomains versus main domains in domain filtering can significantly impact search results. 

1. **Specificity**: Subdomains (e.g., `blog.example.com`) may lead to more targeted content related to that specific subdomain, while using the main domain (e.g., `example.com`) filters results from all its subdomains, providing a broader range of content from the entire domain.

2. **Inclusion/Exclusion**: Specifying the main domain allows filtering out all subdomains uniformly; however, using subdomains may lead to excluding relevant content from the main domain.

3. **Search Quality**: Main domains often capture a wider variety of information and resources, potentially improving the overall quality of search responses compared to filtering down to one subdomain.

Overall, the choice between using main domains and subdomains should align with the desired specificity and breadth of information in the search results.","],

  The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.;This is particularly useful for queries where location significantly impacts relevance, such as:

* Finding local businesses or services.
* Getting information about regional events or news.
* Understanding location-specific regulations or customs.

To refine search results by location, include the `user_location` object within the `web_search_options` in your request payload. You can provide coordinates, a country code, or combine them:

**Using Latitude/Longitude:**

```json
""web_search_options"": {
  ""user_location"": {
    ""latitude"": 37.7749,
    ""longitude"": -122.4194
  }
}
```

**Using Country Code:**

```json
""web_search_options"": {
  ""user_location"": {
    ""country"": ""US""
  }
}
```

**Combining Latitude/Longitude and Country Code:**

```json
""web_search_options"": {
  ""user_location"": {
    ""latitude"": 48.8566, 
    ""longitude"": 2.3522,
    ""country"": ""FR"" // Example: Paris, France
  }
}
```

These filters work alongside other search parameters like date range or domain filters.

## Examples

**1. Refining Results with Latitude and Longitude**

This example provides specific coordinates (approximating San Francisco) to get geographically relevant search results.

**Request Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --location 'https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      ""model"": ""sonar-pro"",
      ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful local guide.""},
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What are some good coffee shops nearby?""}
      ],
      ""web_search_options"": {
        ""user_location"": {
          ""latitude"": 37.7749,
          ""longitude"": -122.4194
        }
      }
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = ""https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions""
  headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_API_KEY""}
  payload = {
      ""model"": ""sonar-pro"",
      ""messages"": [
          {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful local guide."

# Integrating MCP with Perplexity's Sonar API
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/mcp-server

Learn about the MCP server implementation for the Sonar API.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard designed to connect AI assistants with the systems where data lives. By providing a universal interface for AI applications to access structured and unstructured data, MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations, enabling AI models to retrieve real-time, relevant information more efficiently. Learn more about MCP [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## MCP Server for Perplexity's Sonar API

Our **MCP server implementation** for Sonar allows any AI-powered tool to perform real-time, web-wide research using Perplexity’s powerful search engine. This server acts as a bridge between AI applications and the Sonar, enabling seamless integration for retrieving and synthesizing relevant, up-to-date information from the web.

### How It Works

* The **Perplexity Ask MCP Server** follows MCP’s **open standard**, allowing any AI assistant or automation tool to connect to the **Sonar API** for live web searches.
* AI models can query the server for information retrieval, leveraging Perplexity’s search capabilities to return the most relevant insights.

### Example: Using MCP with Claude

Claude is one example of how this MCP server can be used effectively. When connected to Claude, the **Perplexity Ask MCP Server** enables it to **perform live web searches** and return **highly relevant, up-to-date responses**, enhancing its ability to provide real-time knowledge.

### Where to Find the Documentation

Developers looking to integrate and deploy the **Perplexity Ask MCP Server** can find our implementation, detailed documentation, and setup instructions in our official MCP repository:

📖 [**Perplexity Ask MCP Server**](https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main)

This includes:

* Implementation code
* Setup instructions
* Configuration steps
* API usage guidelines
* Deployment and troubleshooting tips
